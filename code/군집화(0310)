why the battery seems to drain when I'm not using it, even after sliding the top control button to off when shutting down .\\n4 great in the car, light, portable, good quality, long battery,scratch resistant .\\n5   5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .\\n6   5GB and the better battery life rated for up to 6 .\\n7battery, not dummie proof  I love the color of this iPod .\\n8  Battery life isn't amazing, Definitely need to get a case for it  I wanted to get a new iPod because I was upgrading from the mini .\\n9  The battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .\\n10  doesn't take pictures, battery life  It's my first ipod, but it's amazing .\\n11  Also, the battery life wasn't that long enough for me, but i'm new to this so it just might me be .\\n12  When you use the radio it uses a lot of battery life  i got this exact iPod for christmas .\\n13   good quality  light  long battery  portable  scratch resistant\\n14   scratches easily, short battery life  I purchased this for my 6 year old son and he LOVES IT !\\n15 Price battery replacement  The iPod basically does what Apple says it does .\\n16   I do not like it that I will have to get Apple to eventually replace the battery .\\n17   I think Apple's idea is that instead of replacing the battery, you will exchange it for a newer iPod .\\n18Make it inconvenient to replace the battery  make it convenient to replace the iPod .\\n19 The Pedometer feature seems accurate, but a battery waster .\\n20 short battery life  I like the product .\\n21   good quality  scratch resistant  light  portable  long battery\\n22Battery life is short  Received as a Christmas gift .\\n23  Battery life isn't great, but other than that, would highly recommend .\\n24Battery Life  Product is exactly as advertised and was probably my wife's favorite gift this past Christmas .\\n25shortened battery life, not kind to beginners  this ipod is a great new item with a camera and built in speaker .\\n26   It is easy to use and has great battery life .\\n27  Thought would have longer battery life before recharge  This is my first iPOD but if endurance is as I expect will not be my last .\\n28  The battery dies quickly and seems to die quicker in cold weather .\\n29Watching any videos drains the battery very quickly .\\n30Battery life is much better as well .\\n31   Shorter battery life than old iPod, camera is in inconvenient spot  When I first listened to a song on this iPod, the first thing that caught my attention was the audio quality .\\n32One thing I noticed that was not so good was the battery life, but I've only charged it once and that was on the computer  as far as I've seen my computer doen't charge well with either of my iPods so the battery life is possibly greater than I thought if using a wall outlet .\\n33   the battery life  this was an awsome christmas present and i love it its really easy to use and sounds great .\\n34 this is my first ipod and its awsome the only thing i dont like is the battery life it lasts all day if you dont use it a lot but if you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .\\n35short battery life,have to keep changing it .\\n36 the battery lasts 4 hours  great product for a great price .\\n37 Battery life is excellent and the LCD display is clear and easy to see .\\n38  Long battery life and easy directions make this a snap to use .\\n39  The battery dies faster than my previous 2nd Gen Nano .\\n40 My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last as long as my previous 2nd gen nano .\\n41The battery is great and the screen as well .\\n42 shipping charges  I bought this ipod as a birthday gift and purchased the battery charger for the auto as well .\\n43 SHORT BATTERY LIFE,SCRATCHES EASY,  I DONT LIKE THE APPLES LIBRARY .\\n44Battery Life  I bought this ipod to replace my 2nd gen 2gb ipod nano, because i filled that one's memory up .\\n45The only bad thing is it's battery life .\\n46   8 hours or less is a more realistic battery life .\\n47  shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp !\\n48  battery life, becuase of all the features  I had an apple ipod 3rd generation and the 5th genteration is twice as good as the numbering would suggest .\\n49   I have not found one thing other than the battery life last for only one full day of use .\\n50   So, the battery thing is not that big a deal .\\n51 Overall, almost perfect just watch out or you will run out of battery life .\\n52  battery life, freezes up  I just got the 5th gen as a replacement for my 2nd gen nano .\\n53the pedometer is also very nice but seems like it drains the battery if you have it in  always on  mode .\\n54 The new Nano has a very short battery life most likely due to all the new features .\\n55  Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .\\n56Easy to use, Great sound, long battery life, love the fact that I can tune in to my favorite radio station, and I'm into exercise so the pedometer with calories burned is a great addition .\\n57  Battery life seems to be good .\\n58 Scratches easily and the battery does not last .\\n59   The battery is not as strong as it should be .\\n60 But the battery is a little bit unpleased, but it is very good .\\n61  Battery life is bad, real bad .\\n62  Long battery life, Decent camera for such a small device, excellent sound quality and easy to use !\\n63 The video camera works great and the battery\\n64   Then
